This playbook is a living document that explains how we run our organization, how we plan our work, develop software and ensure its quality, etc. We try to sum up here all our experience and the best practices to operate our company. 

Anyone at Serendeepia can edit this document at any time. So if you spot something that is wrong or you think something can be improved, feel free to hop in and correct it. Just press <i class="fas fa-pen"></i> in the page you want to fix, edit the [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file in GitHub and open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) with the modifications.

You will see that sometimes we link to documents in Google Drive that you cannot access because they contain information not accesible for everybody in Serendeepia or documents under the folder [_docs_internal](https://github.com/serendeepia/playbook/tree/master/_docs_internal) that we only share internally in Serendeepia. Well, we cannot make everything public (yet). `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
