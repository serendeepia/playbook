We are a remote company, and so, communication is one of the most important things along with a well defined processes. Remember not everybody is in your same timezone, so replies can take sometime to arrive.

## English

You don't have to talk in English in the private slack channels but it is mandatory to speak English when someone is present, or can read the conversation later, and doesn't share your native language.
