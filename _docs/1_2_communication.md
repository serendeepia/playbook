title: Communication
---

We are a remote company, and so, communication is one of the most important things along with a well defined processes. Remember not everybody is in your same timezone, so replies can take sometime to arrive.

## English

Although our headquarters are in a non English-speaking country, we are a remote company and international company, so we try to make all communication inside the company in English. You don't have to talk in English in the private slack channels but it is mandatory to speak English when someone is present, or can read the conversation later, and doesn't share your native language.

## Slack

We use [Slack](https://serendeepia.slack.com) for instant communication. Everybody must be connected to slack during their working hours so they are available for the rest of the team.

We try to talk in public channels so the rest of the team can be aware of the conversation and help. We avoid private communication as much as possible.

Slack is not always the best solution. Sometimes it is faster to jump into a videconference and talk than keep writting. Then come back and write your conclusions in the channel so everybody can be aware of what have been decided.

## Meetings

### General recommendations

If you are hosting a meeting:

* Always send a calendar invite. No matter how quick you plan the meeting to be, make sure you send an invite. This is important so nobody never miss a meeting. Also, too many meetings are harmful for productivity.
* Try to add an agenda describing what is going to be discussed in the meeting and its goal. Meetings without an agenda are doomed to be unproductive.
* Try schedule meetings beforehand and not just hop in for a call at any time. Meetings sometimes need preparation. 
* Check the invitee's calendars before sending an invitation, ensuring that everyone will be able to attend the meeting.

If you are participating:

* Take notes during the meeting and save them somewhere accessible later so you can review what you talked about and the decisions you took.
* You should get used to accept or rejects meetings. This will help you and your team to know that you are aware of the meeting or that you cannot attend and the meeting might need to be reschedule.

Other recommendations:

* Try to reserve some time without meetings or interruptions during the day and respect the time others have reserved for themselves. We all need a couple of hours without interruptions to be completely productive.
* Avoid completely to hop in for meetings with clients whenever they ask you to without prior notification. Clients should get used to scheduling meetings beforehand and not just hop in for a call at any time.
* If you're in a meeting, be in that meeting. In other words, try to contribute as much as possible and keep your attention on the subject. Electronic devices (like cell phones and laptops) should be used only if strictly necessary.
* If you feel that you don't need to be at that meeting anymore, don't feel bad about leaving earlier. Politely ask if your presence is still necessary, explain that you can't afford more time at the moment and leave.

### Daily Stand-up
