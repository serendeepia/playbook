### Conferences

Conferences are the main place to know people and companies interested in [what we do](/1-0-organization#what-we-do). We usually attend local meet ups and use them to get [leads](/5-3-sales#leads) and new contacts.

#### When you are the speaker

The most important thing is that you enjoy the conference. We suggest you to follow the next steps:

1. Know your audience and adapt the contents for them
1. Know the place where the talk is going to be and adapt the slides
1. Plan the contents and the time
1. Add your slides to the [shared folder in marketing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/140VqNvOxKCMIhWyj3SACD6sIkAMliSi5)
1. Link your slides in the website into [slides section](https://github.com/serendeepia/serendeepia.github.io/tree/master/_slides) (don't forget to increase the delay when publishing the embedded slides).

Some general suggestions about slides:

* You shouldn't need them, they are only there to show some extended information but the audience should pay you more attention that to the slides.
* Don't add to much data in one slide (avoid using too many words or the audience will be reading instead of listening).
* Avoid using too many words and use large images, try to be more visual.
* Your presentation should be like a story and it should answer the questions [why, how and what](https://www.disruptiveadvertising.com/business/why-how-what-in-that-order-using-the-golden-circle-to-improve-your-business-yourself/) it that specific order.
