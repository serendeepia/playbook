## After you sing the contract

We will need you to complete our survey to collect some personal information we need from you (the link to the survey is in [_docs_internal](https://github.com/serendeepia/playbook/tree/master/_docs_internal) ). 

## Your first day

### What we do

* Add their information to a common slides
* Add email in google apps (name.surname@serendeepia.com)
* Add them to slack
* Add them to GitHub if necessary
* Add them to Clockify if necessary
* Share the Personal Time Out calendar
* Share some Google Drive folders if necessary

### what you do

You must prepare 2 or 3 slides to introduce yourself to the rest of the company. We expect to know more about you as a person: what things do you love, what are your hobbies, your goals in life, etc. You can make the slides as much fun as you want.

We will use the last minutes of the all-hands weekly meet to introduce yourself.

## When someone leaves us

Well, we are going to be sad but life keeps moving.
