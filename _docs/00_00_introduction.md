In this document we describe how we run our organization, how we plan our work, develop software and ensure its quality. This document is based on our experience, but also in the experience and study of others and is always evolving when we find a better way to do things.

This playbook is a collaborative effort. If you spot something that is wrong, feel free to hop in and correct it. Everyone at Serendeepia can edit this playbook by simply opening a PR (Pull Request) with the desired modifications. In this way, we can discuss it through the PR and keep the discussion archived for future reference.
