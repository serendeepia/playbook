## Experimentation

### How to perform an experiment

1. Pose an hypothesis
2. Find papers that support your hypothesis
3. Prepare and execute the experiment
4. Describe and document results
5. Review initial hypothesis with the results
6. Describe future lines of research

All this information must be included in the README.md file of the experiment.

### How to organize the experiments

See section of project structure.

After the exploratory analysis we add the future lines of research as issues labeled as `enhancements` in GitHub. This way we can assign future experiments and know who is working at what. Every time we finish and experiment and we describe the future lines of research we must add these ones as GitHub issues with the label “enhancement” too.

### How to document the experiments

After each experiment we should estimate resources employed, mostly time and money. This will be useful to budget subsequent experiments.
