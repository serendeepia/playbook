title: Career Path
---

We don't expect you to be doing the same job for the rest of your live. There are few ways to follow your career path depending in your interests:
* _horizontal_: you keep improving in the things you do, learning new techniques of how you do things, teaching others about your experience. Basically you become the reference expert inside and outside the company in what you do.
* _vertical_: you climb the ladder and become more manager in your daily basis. We are a very flat organization but there is room for management, although you will have to keep improving technically too.
* _moving to a different area_: feel free to help other teams or ask them if you feel it is time for you to move and learn something different. We will help you with a smooth transition.
* _moving somewhere else_: yes, sometimes you want to, or have to, leave us and that is ok, although we will be a bit sad. Anyway, we will wish you the best and you will always welcome back.

[One on one meetings](1-2-communication#one-on-one) is one way that can help you in your career path. Talk to your manager about your goals, we will try to help everybody to fulfill their goals.

## Side projects
 
Side projects are the best way to lead your career path. We offer the opportunity to everyone to present ideas and work on them, actually we expect everybody to present ideas from time to time and work on them. You can spend one a day week, or even more if the management thinks it is an strategic product for the company, working in your side project you want. We also support the creating of small teams to work in the same side project, we would like you to try to engage more people in the company to help you out with the project. We strongly suggest you to use the help of the interns, it will be good for both sides. They will learn and you will have more manpower. You will in charge of the project and you will have the whole responsibility to manage everybody who joins the project.

We support two types of side projects: research papers and MVPs (minimum viable products), or, ideally, a mix of them. In any case the project has to be related somehow with the rest of the things we do in the company.

### Requirements

In order th accept and idea as a side project it has to fulfill some minimum requirements:
* You must commit to finish it.
* A senior member of the company must sponsor your project and must be aware of its progression.
* It needs some kind of novelty: either you are going to make research in a new idea, or you have seen a novelty way to solve a problem for people or companies.
* It has to be completed in less than 3 months. We think 3 months is enough time to have some type of result (3 months times 4 weeks times one day a week times 7 hours a day is a total of 84 hours to complete your side project).
* We expect you to show your progress to the rest of the company about your project in [the meetings](/1-2-communication) from time to time.

### Development

As a project it must follow [the phases of a project](/4-0-project-products#main-phases-of-a-project) we have defined and our [agile methodology](/4-1-agile-methodology). Although you might want to adapt it based on the size of the team and the time constraints.
