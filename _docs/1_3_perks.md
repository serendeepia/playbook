## Remote

We are a [remote company](/1-1-remote-team), so you can work from whereever you want as long as you have a good internet connection. Just let your manager and the rest of your team to know what will be your timezone and we are usually good.

## Flexible schedule

We try to follow a [regular workday](/1-1-remote-team#an-usual-workday) but we are flexible. We understand that not everybody performs good at the same time and we sometimes don't feel good enough to be productive. Organize yourself in the best way to be happy and productive. We know that feeling happy with a good balance between personal and professional live is important to achieve [our core values](1-0-organiziation#our-core-values).
