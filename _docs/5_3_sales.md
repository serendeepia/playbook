We use Trello to track our sales pipeline. We have a main [sales pipeline](https://trello.com/b/fzSWX5VJ/sales-pipeline) and another one to explore [international opportunities](https://trello.com/b/cfpL2KeF/sales-international). 

The order of the cards is the priority: top cards have more priority.

## International opportunities

* _Leads_: List of opportunities we can explore.
* _First contact_: Opportunities we have send an email to contact them and let them know about Serendeepia.
* _Not Interested_: Opportunities that replied they are not interested.
* _Explore sale_: Opportunities that replied and seem to be interested. In this point we will move the opportunity to the [sales pipeline](https://trello.com/b/fzSWX5VJ/sales-pipeline)

## Sales Pipeline

* _Partners/networking_: List of people of interest to get new leads.
* _Opportunities to explore_: List of opportunities we can explore.
* _Offer exploration_: First contacts with the person to explore the opportunity.
* _StandBy_: The opportunity is in stand by because it wasn't the right time to approach it.
* _Offer design_: Starting to creating the offer for the client.
* _Offer sent_: Offer sent. Waiting for feedback.
* _Offer accepted_: Offer accepted. Waiting to sign the contract and start.
* _Contract signed / After sales_: Sale completed. Period to follow the satisfaction of the client and to do cross selling.
* _Failed_: Opportunity failed. We need to detect what was the reason to fail in order to learn.

Every card in Trello follows the next format: `_Company name | Proyect name (Contact name)_`

Opportunities can be removed from contract signed and failed. We need to update the Analytics excel when we do that.

## General Process

### Collect leads

We collect leads from different sources, take a look to the [Marketing Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_sIaytaR8YUJmrXI7w_9K6pyFGxJJTCN1UAuUmNb20) to know more about it.

### Leads

Once we have a lead we add it either in the [international opportunities](https://trello.com/b/cfpL2KeF/sales-international) in the `Leads` column if we pro-actively found them or in the [sales pipeline](https://trello.com/b/fzSWX5VJ/sales-pipeline) in the `Opportunities to explore` if they reached us.

### First Contact

Our first contact is different depending whether they know about us or we found them. When we found them se send them a cold email so someone in the management team. If they find us we either reply to their email or phone call and decided where to place the opportunity.

### First Meeting

Our first meeting is usually with a videoconference. If the project is relevant enough we can consider to have a in-person meeting but this is the less desirable option as it is very inefficient.

#### NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)

Usually the Clients provide an Non-Disclosure Agreement with their needs, but in case we need to provide one you can find examples in our shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jEdOqEFGbor-7IXcwfN8g2oIrXmvjgov).

### Engagement

Usually we need more than one meeting to get enough information about the project. Don't rush this step and try to understand the project with all its nuances in order to write a proper offer. You should consider to use our [Methodology of the Viability Screening](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br1BKyKSd2PnLYelgQHN8rZPg7hG_IYSwOZeDvA4Bkk) in order to asses whether the project is feasible and relevant for us or not.

### Offer

We have templates to write an offer:

* [Offer Template English](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NXqLXL_lWxwxerNQPwjKN6V8z1zf-OPkhgZetL3iB1s)
* [Offer Template Spanish](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T3HGgpeMX7bIlXHAWn7kjg-jLR-4no160NVcwVtDBeo)
* [Planning and Budget Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y94zsuV91UoGdFtyM9ZzpRBvw1nyNpP_tqHcMWsRHhA)

Remember to update both templates with new content when it will be relevant for future projects.

### Sign Contract

We do not start a project without the contract being signed for both sides.
