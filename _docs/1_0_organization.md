Of course we follow the [scientific method](3-0-research#scientific-method) and other [good engineering practices](/3-0-research). Our research is also [open source]((/3-0-research#open-source)).
    
### Products

We build products based on the state of the art research with the aim to solve problems for companies and people. We believe AI is creating new markets to explore and those markets need new products. You can see some of our products in our [official products page](http://serendeepia.com/products.html). 
    
### In-company courses and training

Knowledge wouldn't be important if you cannot spread it. We like to help other companies to develop their AI capabilities. We design custom training workshops and courses in the AI topics most relevant for your business. Along with this coursers we help the companies to create their first prototypes in AI to solve some of their business needs.
