## English

Even though we don't live in an English-speaking country, all companyâ€™s communication is done in English. Regardless if it's a private slack chat or a large Basecamp discussion, We believe that's a necessity in order to better communicate with our offshore clients. Every mistake is a learning opportunity, so feedbacks to improve each other's English skills are very much welcomed.
