## Methodology

* Add the expense/revenue to the Profit&Loss:
	* Add the value to the expense/revenue tab
	* Update the CashFlow tab
* Add the document to the correct path: `/YEAR/QUARTER/(EXPENSE|REVENUE)/DATE-NAME` (for invoices use the invoice number instead of the dat).
	* The date must follow the format: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY` with 2 digits for the month and the day.
	* If the document is in other currency than EUROS we must add the correspondent document from the bank with the final value of the operation (it must have the same name and the suffix `_euros`) and any expense it generates (same name with different suffixes as needed).
