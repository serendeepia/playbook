# Guideline for the sales pipeline

## Pipeline

[Trello](https://trello.com/b/fzSWX5VJ/sales-pipeline)

Card format: _Company name | Proyect name (Contact name)_

Columns:
* _Opportunities to explore: List of opportunities we can explore.
* _Offer exploration_: First contacts with the person to explore the opportunity.
* _StandBy_: The opportunity is in stand by because it wasn't the right time to approach it.
* _Offer design_: Starting to creating the offer for the client.
* _Offer sent_: Offer sent. Waiting for feedback.
* _Offer accepted_: Offer accepted. Waiting to sign the contract and start.
* _Contract signed / After sales_: Sale completed. Period to follow the satisfaction of the client and to do cross selling.
* _Failed_: Opportunity failed. We need to detect what was the reason to fail in order to learn.

Opportunities can be removed from conctract signed and failed. We need to update the Analytics excel when we do that.

The order of the cards is the priority: top cards have more priority.

## Analytics

Database with the contacts for the opportunities. Used for analytics at the end of the quarter. This only needs to be updated when a new card in trello is added and when the card is moved to the end columns (contract signed or opportunity failed)
